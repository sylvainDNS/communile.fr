# Project guidelines

You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, Astro framework and Tailwind CSS for scalable web development.

## Key principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's static generation.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.
- Use pnpm as the package manager

## Project structure

- The project is structured in the following folders:
  - `src/components`: Contains the components.
  - `src/images`: Contains the images.
  - `src/layouts`: Contains the layouts.
  - `src/pages`: Contains the pages.
  - `src/styles`: Contains the styles.
  - `src/utils`: Contains the utils.

## Files

- Use kebab-case for file names even for components

## Commit messages

- Use the present tense for the commit message
- Use the imperative mood for the commit message
- Always be clear and concise
